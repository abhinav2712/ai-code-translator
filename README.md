# AI Code Translator

The AI Code Translator is a powerful tool that utilizes advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to automatically translate code from one programming language to another. With this tool, developers can save significant amounts of time and effort by not having to manually rewrite code in a new language.

## Getting Started
To use the AI Code Translator, simply upload your code file in the original programming language and select the target programming language you wish to translate to. The AI algorithm will then analyze your code and provide a translated version in the target language.

## Accuracy and Performance
The AI Code Translator has been extensively tested to ensure the highest level of accuracy and performance. However, please note that due to the complexity of programming languages, there may be some cases where the translated code may require minor manual adjustments to ensure functionality.

## Security and Privacy
The AI Code Translator takes data privacy and security very seriously. All uploaded code files are securely processed and immediately deleted after translation. We do not store any of your code files or translated code.
